/// Interface and Main method for use [on_audio_room].
///
/// [on_audio_room] is a [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) Package used to create a
/// "room" to storage audio sections.
///
/// RoomTypes:
///
/// * Favorites.
/// * Last Played.
/// * MostPlayed.
/// * Playlists.
///     * Playlist songs.
///

  /// Internal Controller to keep the package clean and organized.

  //Room methods

  /// Used to init/open room's
  ///
  /// Usage:
  ///
  /// * Call [initRoom] before [runApp] or [navigate] to another screen that **REQUIRE**
  /// call any room.
  /// * If you don't define [roomType], only the room's path will be loaded, but
  /// you **CAN'T** call any method
  ///
  /// Parameters:
  ///
  /// * [roomType] this will define which room will be opened/loaded/used.
  /// * [subDir] this will be the path to create/load room's.
  ///
  /// Important:
  ///
  /// * This method will **ONLY** work 100% if you add a [async/await], if don't,
  /// the widget will load almost in the same time and will throw a error.
  /// * You **CAN** open all the room's at the same time, **BUT**, this will
  /// require a lof of memory. I **DON'T** recommend.
  /// * **REMEMBER TO CLOSE THE ROOM'S BEFORE [DISPOSE]**.
  ///
  /// Example:
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// void main() async {
  ///   //Init Room.
  ///   await OnAudioRoom().initRoom(RoomType.FAVORITES);
  ///   runApp(MaterialApp(home: MyApp()));
  /// }
  /// ```
  ///
  /// Return:
  ///
  /// * [initRoom] will **ALWAYS** return a [bool]:
  ///   * [true] if the room/path is loaded
  ///   * [false] if something wrong happend or path is [null]
  ///
  /// See also:
  ///
  /// * [closeRoom]
  Future<bool> initRoom([RoomType? roomType, String? subDir]) async {
    await Hive.initFlutter(subDir);
    return roomType == null ? true : await roomType.openRoom;
  }

  /// Used to close room's
  ///
  /// Usage:
  ///
  /// * Call [closeRoom] before [dispose]. This will avoid memory leaks.
  ///
  /// Example:
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// @override
  /// void dispose() {
  ///   OnAudioRoom().closeRoom();
  ///   super.dispose();
  /// }
  /// ```
  ///
  /// See also:
  ///
  /// * [initRoom]
  void closeRoom() => Hive.close();

  /// Used to delete the file which contains the box and closes the box.
  ///
  /// Important:
  ///
  /// * You **CAN'T** revert this deletion.
  ///
  /// Return:
  ///
  /// * [deleteRoomFile] will **ALWAYS** return a [bool]:
  ///   * [true] if the file was deleted.
  ///   * [false] if something wrong happend.

  /// * [getRoomInfo] will **ALWAYS** return a [RoomEntity] with this informations:
  ///   * Name
  ///   * Path
  ///   * isEmpty
  ///   * isOpen
  ///   * length
  ///   * keys
  ///   * values

  ///
  /// Important:
  ///
  /// * For now if you add two entities with the same information, will be added.
  /// You can use [checkIn] to make sure that the song was already added.

  ///
  /// * A [entity] is a [Map<dynamic, dynamic>]. You have two options:

  ///   * [1] Create a manual entity.
